# NEXT-SASS

Why would I use this?

* Quickly start a project with TypeScript, SASS, and NextJS.
* You got tired of using CSS-in-JS.
* You want to run a quick website.

### Setup (MacOS)

Start by cloning the repository, or by clicking on **Use this template** above.

Then run the server

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3005` in your browser of choice. Enjoy!
